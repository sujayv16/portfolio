## 🛠️ Setup & Run Locally
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sujayv16/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

### **2. Open in Browser**
Since this is a static website, you can open `index.html` directly:

- Open the `index.html` file in a browser OR
- Use a live server extension in VS Code:
  - Install the "Live Server" extension
  - Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"

## 🌍 Deployment (GitHub Pages)
Changes pushed to the main branch automatically update the live website.

### **Steps to Update:**
1. Make changes to your project.
2. Commit and push:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated portfolio"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Wait a few minutes, then refresh your GitHub Pages link.
